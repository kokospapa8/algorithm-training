> <b>Promblem</b> is in class `P or NP` (not solution)

# Polynomial Time : Class P
- if solution <b> exists</b> : solved in polynomial time 


# Non-Deterministic Polynomial Time : Class NP
- input and output is not always the same 
- if solution <b> exists</b> : sovled in polynomial time 

There for NP includes P 

## NP-Hard
- traveling sales person problem 
- can be NP or not 

## NP-Complete
- NP-Hard & NP
